We had limit till 5 so, We can give any limit like 1(only 1 product of that page), 2(only 2 product of that page), 3(only 3 product of that page),
4(only 4 product of that page), 5(all product of that page)
Pages are till 6, bcoz we had inserted only 28 records of products, so till page 5 => We had 5 records of products-per page;
On page 6, we had only 3 records.
